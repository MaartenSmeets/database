apx_json.sql is based on APEX_JSON version 19.1 (documentation from https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/application-express/19.1/aeapi/APEX_JSON.html#GUID-11919ED6-CE3D-4497-8733-F56CD27B6BFF can be used) and can be deployed on Oracle 11gR2 without the requirement to install APEX. Use at your own risk. I do not provide any guarantees on its functioning. If you want to use a solid Oracle supported APEX_JSON, use the one which is installed as part of Oracle APEX.
